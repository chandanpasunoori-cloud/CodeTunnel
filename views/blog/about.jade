    div CodeTunnel.com is my personal blog built using Node.js. The <a href="https://github.com/Chevex/CodeTunnel">source code</a> can be found on <a href="https://github.com/chevex">my Github</a> account. This site used to written in ASP.NET MVC 3 until I decided to dive into Node.js head first. My personal blog was a great place to start with Node. The Node version of CodeTunnel, or as I like to call it "NodeTunnel", was blast to work on. Node.js is a platform written specifically with the web in mind.

    div I love JavaScript. Being able to use JavaScript in the browser, on the server, and even JSON (or BSON if you want to get all technical) in the database with MongoDB is a luxury I never thought I'd experience. JavaScript is increadibly powerful, moreso than I think anyone realized only a few years ago. All it really needed was a basic foundation to eliminate some of the grunt work and a fast engine to process it. Node.js is a gift unto the web world and after redesigning CodeTunnel I found myself thinking <i>Node where have you been all my life?</i>.
