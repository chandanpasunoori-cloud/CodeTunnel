It allows you to quickly and easily write commands and plug them into the shell framework. Rather than assuming the UI, such as the Javascript console, shotgun returns a result object that acts as a set of instructions so that any application can easily consume it, including web applications. In fact, I took the liberty of writing a separate module called [shotgun-client](https://npmjs.org/package/shotgun-client) that makes it simple to integrate shotgun with any web application.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/zUsgxFW.gif)\r\n\r\nTo learn more head over to the [shotgun wiki](https://github.com/Chevex/shotgun/wiki).",
